View the full list of groups available this semester For many concerns that college students face  like overwhelming emotions, difficult relationships and adjustments, academic problems  a group context is the best option for getting support. In fact, groups are often even more beneficial than 1-on-1 counseling. Groups, classes, and workshops offer a unique opportunity in which peer interactions facilitate self-improvement and the alleviation of suffering. Participants often find that they feel less alone in their struggles and that the group provides a sense of community. At CMHC, we offer a wide variety of therapy groups, therapeutic classes, and skill-building workshops that address a range of student needs. Although some students are initially hesitant to consider participating in a group, those who join consistently find this form of support to be a very beneficial and positive experience. New groups form each semester. Most therapy and support groups consist of about 5 to 10 members. Classes and workshops, which incorporate more education and skill-building, may be a bit larger. Most groups begin a few weeks into the semester and last 8 to 10 weeks (concluding before finals), though some may be shorter. In most cases, you have an opportunity to meet with the facilitator(s) to discuss your interest, while other groups can be attended on a drop-in basis. If the group youre interested in is full, you may wish to call (512) 471-3515 or come by CMHC Monday through Friday between 8am and 5pm to discuss your needs. If you have any questions about our groups, please contact Dr. Kate Czar, who oversees the group program, at (512) 471-3515.
